|| Ver. 0.0.1 ||

- Changed "$(TARGET): $(OBJS) debugtoken $(TARGETDIR)" to
	"$(TARGET): $(OBJS) $(TARGETDIR) debugtoken" to create the target directory
	before the Debug Token
- Connect.jar PID file is stored in a variable, then deleted in case the kill
	command fails
- Killing the Connect.jar PID is working by getting the current process ID + 2
	(due to	the running process being a new shell [guess])
- Removed token found output [seems like too much information]
